// A comment in C programming is a textual explanation or note within the source code that is ignored by the compiler. It is used to document code for better understanding and maintenance.

C programming language supports two types of comments:

• Single-line comments: These comments begin with // and continue until the end of the line. They are used for short explanations or comments on a single line of code.

• Multi-line comments: These comments are enclosed between /* and */ and can span multiple lines. They are useful for longer explanations or commenting out multiple lines of code.



Comments in C programming are important because they enhance code readability, document code functionality, explain complex logic, provide context for future modifications, and facilitate collaboration among programmers.
