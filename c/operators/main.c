C supports several types of operators, including:

1. Arithmetic Operators
Arithmetic operators perform mathematical calculations.

• + : Addition (e.g., a + b)
• - : Subtraction (e.g., a - b)
• * : Multiplication (e.g., a * b)
• / : Division (e.g., a / b)
• % : Modulus (remainder of division) (e.g., a % b)

2. Relational Operators
Relational operators compare two operands and return a boolean value (true or false).

• == : Equal to (e.g., a == b)
• != : Not equal to (e.g., a != b)
• > : Greater than (e.g., a > b)
• < : Less than (e.g., a < b)
• >= : Greater than or equal to (e.g., a >= b)
• <= : Less than or equal to (e.g., a <= b)

3. Logical Operators
Logical operators are used to combine conditional statements.

• && : Logical AND (e.g., a && b)
• || : Logical OR (e.g., a || b)
• ! : Logical NOT (e.g., !a)

4. Bitwise Operators
Bitwise operators perform operations on binary representations of numbers.

• & : Bitwise AND (e.g., a & b)
• | : Bitwise OR (e.g., a | b)
• ^ : Bitwise XOR (exclusive OR) (e.g., a ^ b)
• ~ : Bitwise NOT (e.g., ~a)
• << : Left shift (e.g., a << 2)
• >> : Right shift (e.g., a >> 2)

5. Assignment Operators
Assignment operators assign values to variables.

• = : Assignment (e.g., a = b)
• += : Add and assign (e.g., a += b)
• -= : Subtract and assign (e.g., a -= b)
• *= : Multiply and assign (e.g., a *= b)
• /= : Divide and assign (e.g., a /= b)
• %= : Modulus and assign (e.g., a %= b)
• &= : Bitwise AND and assign (e.g., a &= b)
• |= : Bitwise OR and assign (e.g., a |= b)
• ^= : Bitwise XOR and assign (e.g., a ^= b)
• <<=: Left shift and assign (e.g., a <<= 2)
• >>=: Right shift and assign (e.g., a >>= 2)

6. Increment and Decrement Operators
These operators increment or decrement a variable's value by 1.

• ++ : Increment (e.g., ++a or a++)
• -- : Decrement (e.g., --a or a--)

7. Conditional (Ternary) Operator
The ternary operator is a shorthand for an if-else statement.

• ?: : Ternary conditional (e.g., condition ? value_if_true : value_if_false)

8. Comma Operator
The comma operator separates two or more expressions.

• , : Comma (e.g., a = 1, b = 2, c = a + b)

9. Sizeof Operator
The sizeof operator returns the size, in bytes, of a data type or a variable.

• sizeof : Sizeof (e.g., sizeof(int) or sizeof(a))

10. Pointer Operators
Pointer operators are used with pointers and addresses.

• & : Address-of (returns the memory address) (e.g., &a)
• * : Dereference (returns the value at the memory address) (e.g., *ptr)

11. Member Access Operators
These operators are used to access members of structures or unions.

• . : Member access (e.g., structVariable.member)
• -> : Pointer to member (e.g., structPointer->member)
